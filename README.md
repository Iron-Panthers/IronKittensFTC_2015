## Logging in Android:

To log a message, use the method `DbgLog.msg("your message")`. DbgLog is found in the package `com.qualcomm.ftccommon.DbgLog`. To read your logs, connect the phone to a computer and find a file called `com.qualcomm.ftcrobotcontroller.logcat`. This is where all the messages sent through `DbgLog` end up.
