public class DriveAuto
{
	//initialize classes and run stuff first

	void DriveStraight(double distance, double speed)
	{
		1. set speed same for both motors and drive

		2. if statement to check if it reached distance, use encoders

		3. stop if it reaches distance

		4. reset encoders
	}

	void Turn(double angle)
	{
		1. stop all motors, set speed to 0

		2. set speed opposite to each other to turn one way

		3. use angles to determine how far they turned

		4. when it reaches a spacific angle, stop turning, using encoders

		5. reset encoders
